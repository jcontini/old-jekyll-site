As an informal worker:

When I’m getting hired
—- What should my minimum wage be?
—- They want to keep my birth certificate. Do I give it to them?

When I got fired
—- Are they allowed to do that?
—- What benefits am I entitled to?

When I get injured
—- Where can I get healthcare fastest?
—- How can I afford this?
