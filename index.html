  <h1>Hi there!</h1>
  <h2>I'm Joe.</h2>
  <p>I suffer from extreme curiousity which leads to hundreds of interests, tens of hobbies, and never enough time. I read a lot and experiment a fair bit. This blog will hopefully become a respository of things I found useful that others might too.
  <p>I've always been interested in dreams. The ones where you wake up with memories that you didn't have yesterday. I'm building a intelligent dream journal app that uses artificial intelligence to privately reveal personal dream patterns, and publicly identify global dream trends from the collective subconsciousness. More on that once we launch in July 2016.</p>
  <p>For my day job, I'm building digital services in Indonesia through an Ausaid program based in Jakarta. I believe that governments serve their citizens best when they make data-driven decisions and focus on the user experience.</p>
  <p>
    Here are some <a href="quotes.html">quotes</a> that I like, <a href="links.html">links</a> that you might find useful, and more <a href="/about.html">about me</a>.
