  <h1>Hi there!</h1>
  <h2>I'm Joe.</h2>
  <p>I suffer from extreme curiousity which leads to hundreds of interests, tens of hobbies, and never enough time. I read a lot and experiment a fair bit. This blog will hopefully become a respository of things I found useful that others might too.
  <p>I've always been interested in dreams - the ones where you wake up with memories that you didn't have yesterday. I'm building a dream journal app that uses AI (NLP &amp; entity extraction) to find and reveal hidden patterns in dreams. Launching MVP on Android in Q4 2016.</p>
  <p>My day job is building user-centric digital services in Indonesia, through an Australian aid project focused on promoting good governance (<a href="http://kompak.or.id/">KOMPAK</a>).</p>
  <p>
    Here are some <a href="quotes.html">quotes</a> that I like, <a href="links.html">links</a> that you might find useful, and more <a href="/about.html">about me</a>.
