  <h1>Hi there!</h1>
  <h2>I'm Joe. I like solving problems and making things better.</h2>
  <p>
    Currently, I'm building digital services in Indonesia through an Ausaid program based in Jakarta. I believe that governments serve their citizens best when they make data-driven decisions and focus on improving user experiences. My goal is to make that happen more often.
    <br /><br />
    Here are some <a href="quotes.html">quotes</a> that I like, <a href="links.html">links</a> that you might find useful, and more <a href="/about.html">about me</a>.
