        <p>
        In April 2015, I moved to Jakarta to work as the ICT lead for an <a href="http://staging.abtjta.com.au/practice-areas/international-development/kompak/">Australian aid program</a> that focuses on improving service delivery and economic opportunities for Indonesians.</p>

        <p>Before that, I lived in Boston and DC doing technology consulting for US government health agencies (HHS) and USAID programs. Through the latter, I had the opportunity to work with health ministries in Africa and the Cariibbean, and gained an appreciation for <a href="http://tech.abtassociates.com/engagements/">building ICT solutions</a> in low-connectivity settings.</p>

        <p>I'm a big fan of the <a href="http://digitalprinciples.org/">Principles for Digital Development</a>, and think that the ICT4D scene can learn a lot from digital service agencies like those in the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/#plays_index_anchor">US</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default">UK</a>, and <a href="https://www.dto.gov.au/">Australia</a>.</p>

        <p>My free time is filled with reading, exploring Asia, nerding out, and hanging out with good people. My current interests are renewable energy, behavioral psychology, sustainable social enterprises, javascript, open data, web scraping, web development, IT security, building data vizualizations, and talking too fast.</p>
