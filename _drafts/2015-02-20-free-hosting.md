title: Hosting websites for free
---

The impetus for this post is my ICT experiences in international development. There is often a desire to build sustainable websites and dashboards for a local government or NGO, and yet no funding can be guaranteed after the end of the project. Without someone to pay the bill, even the simplest websites will dissapear when the hosting bill is overdue.

Fortunately, companies have begun to pass the savings down to their customers as technology gets cheaper and cheaper. The three services below offer timeless free hosting for simple websites, with very few caveats. None ask for a credit card, and a custom domain can still used on all three.

This post is intended for front-end developers. If you have no experience with HTML/CSS, jump to the '[Website Builders](#builders)' section for some options that require no almost no tech skills.

## [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) ##

Github Pages is great for websites that are updated only occasionally, like blogs, landing pages, resource pages, or simple brochure websites. Because Github is a file repository, this does require a basic HTML & CSS skillset. There are a number of free templates online to build simple 1-page or multi-page websites.

For hobbyists, this is a great place to practice learning new front-end frameworks like Bootstrap or Zurb. If you're building a multi-page website, I highly recommend [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It's a simple yet highly customizeable static site generator that requires only beginner programming skills through the [liquid](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics/operators) templating language. This website was built with Jekyll and is hosted in Github Pages.

also not intended for theHaving used services like GoDaddy, Network Solutions, HostGator, and DreamHost (by far my favorite), 

Most folks have heard of GoDaddy or Network Solutions as hosting providers. Companies like these seem to spend their profits on marketing instead of performance or customer support. Having both personal and client experience with both, I can tell you that you'll receive much better service from vendors like HostGator or [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?1115966), my personal favorite going on 4 years.
