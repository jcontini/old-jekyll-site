Hi! My name is Joe Contini. Building websites is a huge part of my job, and yet I haven't had my own proper place on the web, so here is my attempt at a personal website. My main reason for building this site is to have a place to experiment with web technologies as a hobby, sharpen my front-end dev skills, share resources with others, and find like-minded people to collaborate with. So, a bit about me.

I grew up in upstate NY, studied engineering a few hours from home, moved to Worcester MA for grad school where I worked part time for a [web startup](http://andplus.com/), and then moved to Boston to work for a technology consulting group within [Abt Associates](http://abtassociates.com), where I discovered the world of international development. We provide technology consulting and implementation services for US agenices as well as for projects in developing countries, a field better known as ICT4D. The team quadroupled in size, and after about 3 years I came to DC to expand the practice to our Bethesda office. DC has turned out to be one of the funnest cities I've lived in.

Travel is a favorite activity, and I take short trips every few months for work, usually to Africa (Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Malawi) or the Asia-Pacific (Indonesia & Australia). I've met some of the most inspiring and interesting people overseas, and it's fascinating to see both the differences and similarities amung cultures.

In my free time I enjoy reading, hacking together bits of code, socializing with friends, going on mini-trips, and trying new things. I have a ton of [interests](/links.html), which will become apparent as I add more content to the site. If we share a similar passion and you're interested in collaborating on a side project, hit me up.

Cheers,
Joe
