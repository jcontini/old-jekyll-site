Hi! My name is Joe Contini. I built this site to as an online lab to experiment with new technologies, share resources that others will hopefully find interesting or useful, and to keep myself busy on days when it's too cold to go outside.

I grew up in upstate NY, studied engineering a few hours from home, moved to Worcester MA for grad school where I worked part time for a [web startup](http://andplus.com/), and then moved to Boston to work for a tech lab at [Abt Associates](http://abtassociates.com), where I discovered the world of international development. We provide technology consulting and implementation services for US agenices as well as foreign governments in developing countries, a field better known as ICT4D. Our team quadroupled in size, and after about 3 years I came to DC to expand the practice to a more temperate climate closer to our clients. DC has turned out to be one of the best cities I've lived in.

Travel is a favorite activity, and I take short trips every few months for work, usually to Africa (Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Malawi) or the Asia-Pacific (Indonesia & Australia). I've met some of the most inspiring and interesting people overseas, and it's fascinating to see both the differences and similarities amung cultures.

In my free time I enjoy reading, hacking together bits of code, socializing with friends, going on mini-trips, trying new things, and 2048. I have a ton of [interests](/links.html), which will become apparent as I add more content to the site. If we share a similar passion and you're interested in collaborating on a side project, hit me up.

Cheers,
Joe
