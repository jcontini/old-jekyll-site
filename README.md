Joe Contini - Personal Site
============

My personal place on the web. Powered by Jekyll and Github Pages.

Fork of [Herring Cove](https://github.com/arnp/herring-cove) Jekyll theme. Thanks [Ravi!](https://github.com/arnp).

### Notable changes in this fork ###

Most elements of the site are now data-driven from JSON files in /_data instead of hardcoded to HTML templates.

* Sidebar and mobile navigation links defined in nav.json
* Links are defined in links.json, with support for categories and tags
* Added Quotes page
* Removed the project page since I'm not using it.
* Removed most CSS for links & projects pages
